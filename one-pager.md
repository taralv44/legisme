## Mission of LegisMe
The mission of LegisMe is to increase public engagement and knowledge of the democratic process. LegisMe recognizes both the importance of and difficulty of engaging in representative democracy. By providing a platform through which users can engage with their elected representatives, LegisMe hopes to simplify how constituents engage with their representatives.

## What is LegisMe?
- LegisMe is a platform through which users can engage with their representatives at the Congressional, state, and local levels by "voting" on the same legislation that their respective representatives vote on.

- LegisMe helps a legislator inform their constituents by providing a platform through which a legislator can inform users in their district of their positions on legislation and nominations.

- LegisMe encourages user participation by providing micro-payments to users in exchange for utilizing user's data in order to provide data sources to interested parties.

- LegisMe is owned and operated by Plebeian Technologies Incorporated, a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation which has the explicit goal of increasing civic engagement.

- LegisMe does not create media content, instead LegisMe makes use of publicly available information and media from a variety of sources in order to inform users about legislation.

## What LegisMe Needs
- Information. From legislators at all levels of the political process LegisMe needs information regarding a legislator's positions on pieces of legislation that will be voted on. LegisMe can use this information present a representative's views on legislation and also inform its users about what a bill does.

- Dialogue. LegisMe needs to maintain a continuous dialogue with representatives at all levels in order to make sure LegisMe is itself both engaging and informative. LegisMe considers partner legislators a crucial element in its quality.

- Outreach. To help you better reach and understand your constituents LegisMe needs to be able to reach them. Please consider advocating on LegisMe's behalf at constituent events in your state, district or municipality.
